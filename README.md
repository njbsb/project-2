# project-ttm analytics
python for data cleanup, matching, create pptx

# notes
- executable files and codes can be found within wxpythonui folder
- it's faster to just run the python file rather than the .exe file
- the codes are not fully and tested for extreme use cases. please notify if defects are found. or else please check format of the input file before running the program
- py file with 'lib' in its name is library file/dependency required to run the main code file, do not separate them and keep in the same folder
- main file ui is located in 'wxpython_ui/{project folder name}/', starts with "app_... .py", just double click on that if you want to run the .py file directly (make sure you have python installed first, or else use the .exe file)
